** forgot to add the description for the fav_icon > tap the fav_icon to set the store as favourite.
1)I choose to Implement MVP patteren for the given requirement .which is good for TDD. 
2) Used Rx java in fetching the api .rx handles the threads efficiently. 
3) used some of the libraries Glide, ButterKnife , retrofit which optimizes the app further. 
4) can be optimized more on the sorting logic when fav selected . currently im using treeMap with sortedset but it can be done using single datastructure. 
5) facebook and twiltter integration can be added . 
6) used dummy data to create the app as the api was down from last week , today it was up . 
7) dagger can be implemented for reducing th edependecy and easy for testing . I would change the architecute to support dagger if i would have time . 
8)forgot to add the cleanUp in onDestroy(). 
9)Orientation change can be hadled differently at present when the user rotate the device it will launch the activity by removing the fragment if the user was in the fragment while rotation. this can be changed to remain on the same UI even after rotation . specific steps were not mentioned for orientation changes in the requirement.

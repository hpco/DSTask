1)I choose to Implement MVP patteren for the given requirement .which is good for TDD. 
2) Used Rx java in fetching the api .rx handles the threads efficiently. 
3) used some of the libraries  Glide, ButterKnife , retrofit which optimizes the app further.
4) can be optimized more on the  sorting logic when fav selected . currently im using treeMap with sortedset but it can be done using single datastructure.
5) facebook and twiltter integration can be added .
6) used dummy data to create the app as the api was down from last week , today it was up .
7) dagger can be implemented for  reducing th edependecy and easy for testing . I would change the architecute to support dagger if i would have time .
